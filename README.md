I built this Wordle clone to learn more about React - and it worked wonders, I learned tons of new things thanks to it.
As it's possible to see, many parts of the project are commented - I plan to comment it all, for good measure.

I have built everything here from scratch - and I didn't want to waste too much time fiddling with CSS to make it look identical, so it just looks similar.
The game is fully functional - and it changes word every midnight.

You can see it deployed at https://maxpace.net/wordle-italiano/
