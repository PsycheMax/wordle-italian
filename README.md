I built this Wordle clone to learn more about React - and it worked wonders!
As it's possible to see, many parts of the project are commented - I want to comment it all.

I have built everything here from scratch - and I didn't want to waste too much time fiddling with CSS to make it look identical.
The game is fully functional.
